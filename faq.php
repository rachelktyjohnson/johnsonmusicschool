    <h2>General</h2>
    <h4>What are your teaching dates?</h4>
    <p>We follow the NSW School Term Dates.</p>
    <h4>Where is the school?</h4>
    <p>We are located in Suite 209, 30 Campbell Street, Blacktown. There is ample parking nearby in Colo Lane Car Park or the Workers Club Car Park.</p>
    <h4> Do I have to own my own instrument?</h4>
    <p>It is suggested that you own your own instrument, as home-practice is essential in musical learning. Students must bring their guitar, ukulele, bass instrument to class, along with amp/pedalboard if requested by the teacher. A piano is available for lessons at the school.</p>
    <h4>Do you teach adults?</h4>
    <p>Yes! We cater to musicians of all ages and levels.</p>
    <h4>How much home-practice is required?</h4>
    <p>We recommend 10-15 minutes a day. We understand that practice opportunities differ between families. Understand that the more practice partaken, the more enjoyment and improvement will result. Know that it takes parental involvement as a young student is unlikely to intimate their own practice.</p>
